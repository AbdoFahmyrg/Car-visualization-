## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing various technical specifications and environmental metrics for vehicles. The objective is to gain insights into vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and CO2 emissions across different manufacturers, models, and years of production.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes several key columns:

id: A unique identifier for each vehicle.
make: The manufacturer of the vehicle (e.g., Toyota, Ford).
model: The specific model of the vehicle (e.g., Corolla, Mustang).
year: The year in which the vehicle was manufactured.
VClass: The vehicle class, such as compact, midsize, or SUV.
drive: The type of drive system (e.g., front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive, all-wheel drive).
trans: The transmission type, including automatic and manual.
fuelType: The type of fuel used by the vehicle, such as gasoline, diesel, or electricity.
cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
displ: The engine displacement measured in liters.
co2: The CO2 emissions of the vehicle, typically measured in grams per kilometer.
feScore: A fuel efficiency score that ranges from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most efficient.
ghgScore: A greenhouse gas emissions score, also ranging from 1 to 10, where 10 indicates the lowest emissions.
Fuel_usage: The amount of fuel the vehicle consumes, typically measured in liters per 100 kilometers or miles per gallon.
value: A general value metric that could represent market value, fuel cost, or another relevant factor.
efficiency: A measure of the vehicle's efficiency, potentially relating to fuel usage or overall performance.
pv_value: A specific value related to the vehicle, which may need further context.

## Usage
The project involves several steps, including data cleaning, data visualization, and running various analyses to extract insights from the dataset.

## Key Visualizations
The project includes several important visualizations, such as:

Bar Charts to compare average CO2 emissions by manufacturer.
Scatter Plots to examine the relationship between engine displacement and CO2 emissions.
Box Plots to compare fuel usage distribution across different vehicle classes.
Heatmaps to explore correlations between variables like CO2 emissions, fuel usage, and engine size.
